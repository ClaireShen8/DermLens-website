          <b>DermLens</b> is a computer vision research project of
          <a href="https://www.shendermatology.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shen Dermatology</a>
          (Temecula, California) focused on developing quantitative tools for monitoring treatment response during non-surgical skin cancer therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The foundation of this work is SC-8000, a longitudinal clinical imaging dataset comprising over 8,000 photographs collected between 2008
          and the present. The dataset documents patients before and throughout treatment with the Shen Cocktail, a combination topical immunotherapy
          for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Images are captured at baseline and at regular intervals during a typical
          six-week treatment course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike many dermatology datasets designed for lesion diagnosis, SC-8000 is purpose-built for treatment monitoring. All images represent a
          single therapeutic protocol administered under a consistent clinical framework, enabling detailed study of longitudinal visual biomarkers,
          particularly erythema (treatment-induced redness) and its progression over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of DermLens is to develop interpretable, clinically meaningful computer vision methods that quantify changes in erythema and
          related visual features during treatment. Rather than classifying lesions, our work focuses on measuring within-patient change over time
          and integrating image-derived signals with patient-reported symptoms to support clinical decision-making during follow-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe SC-8000 is unique in its scale, duration, and longitudinal consistency, representing more than 15 years of real-world clinical
          practice using a single non-surgical therapy. DermLens welcomes collaboration with medical image computing and machine learning researchers
          interested in longitudinal analysis, color-based biomarkers, and clinically grounded computer vision methods for treatment monitoring.
